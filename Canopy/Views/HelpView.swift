                    When working with Claude Code, you often want to run multiple tasks in parallel — a feature branch, a bug fix, and a refactor, all at the same time. But each Claude session needs its own working directory to avoid conflicts.

                    Canopy manages this with **git worktrees**: lightweight checkouts of the same repo at different paths, each with its own branch. Claude Code runs in each worktree independently, and Canopy keeps them organized.
